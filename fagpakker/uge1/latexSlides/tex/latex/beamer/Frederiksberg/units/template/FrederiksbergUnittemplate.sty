% Template for a Frederiksberg unit style file.
% Morten Larsen, 2009-09-01
%
% The convention is supposed to be that you have all the files specific to
% a unit (or related units) together in one subdirectory under
% Frederiksberg/units. The style file which is loaded when the option
% unit=X is given to frederiksberg will be FrederiksbergUnitX.sty
% (so this file would be loaded if you specified the option unit=template).

% The unit style file is loaded prior to the setting up and processing
% of options for Frederiksberg (except the unit and course options).

% Here we can set up things which the user can override by giving options to
% Frederiksberg:
%\PassOptionsToPackage{life}{beamerthemeKUsetup}
%\PassOptionsToPackage{lrimage=mytitlepageimage}{beamerinnerthemeKUtitlepage}
%\PassOptionsToPackage{style=institute}{beamerouterthemeKUhead}

% The unit style file can add to different hook macros in order to inject
% code to be executed at certain times during the setting up of Frederiksberg.

% The hook \Frederiksberg@AfterOptionsDefinition is called after the
% Frederiksberg options have been defined but before they are processed.
% This means that this file could set up additional package options
% for Frederiksberg by adding code to the hook:
\g@addto@macro\Frederiksberg@AfterOptionsDefinition{
  %\DeclareOptionBeamer{mynewoption}[default value]{option code}
}

% The macro \Frederiksberg@AfterOptionsProcessing is called after Frederiksberg
% options have been processed but before the overall style has been set up
% (and before any subthemes have been loaded). This could be a relevant place
% to post-process options set up by the unit style.
\g@addto@macro\Frederiksberg@AfterOptionsProcessing{
  % Code here...
}

% The macro \Frederiksberg@BeforePackages is called immediately before
% the subthemes are loaded (so after Frederiksberg has set up all the
% options to be passed to the various subthemes).
% This could be another relevant place to post-process options set up by
% the unit style.
\g@addto@macro\Frederiksberg@BeforePackages{
  % Code here...
}

% Anything to be set up after all the theme packages have been processed
% must go into the macro \Frederiksberg@AfterPackages. At this point
% e.g. language and faculty and the various styles have been set up.
\g@addto@macro\Frederiksberg@AfterPackages{
  % For example, to set up the institiute depending on language selected:
  %\ifx\KU@language\KU@dk
  %  \institute{Dansk navn}
  %\else
  %  \institute{English name}
  %\fi
}
